Hi! I'm Surya. 

I'm a third year PhD student of mathematics at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and the University of Toronto. My advisor is [Kevin Costello](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/people/kevin-costello). My work lies somewhere at the intersection of mathematical physics, algebraic geometry, and representation theory. More specifically, I am interested in applications of techniques from [derived](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derived_algebraic_geometry) and [noncommutative](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/derived+noncommutative+geometry) geometry to the study of [supersymmetric gauge theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetric_gauge_theory) and [superstring theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstring_theory), and in using such ideas from physics as an organizing framework for [geometric representation theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/geometric+representation+theory). For a more detailed description of my past and current projects, check out my [research](https://sraghavendran.github.io/research/) page.
