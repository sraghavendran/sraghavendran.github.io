Hi! I'm Surya. 

I'm a Gibbs Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at Yale University. 

I like to work on problems in geometry and representation theory that explore ideas in high energy physics. For more details check out my [research](https://sraghavendran.github.io/research/) page or my [CV](https://sraghavendran.github.io/files/CV/cv.pdf).

Before coming to Yale, I completed my PhD in mathematics at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and the University of Toronto, where my advisor was [Kevin Costello](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/people/kevin-costello). Before that, I was an undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin.
