Hi! I'm Surya. 

I'm a fifth year PhD student of mathematics at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and the University of Toronto. My advisor is [Kevin Costello](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/people/kevin-costello). I like to work on problems in geometry and representation theory that explore ideas in high energy physics. For more details check out my [research](https://sraghavendran.github.io/research/) page.
