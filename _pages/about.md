Hi! I'm Surya. 

I'm a final year PhD student studying mathematics at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and the University of Toronto. My advisor is [Kevin Costello](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/people/kevin-costello). 

I like to work on problems in geometry and representation theory that explore ideas in high energy physics. For more details check out my [research](https://sraghavendran.github.io/research/) page or my [CV](https://sraghavendran.github.io/files/CV/cv.pdf).

Starting Fall 2023 I will be a Gibbs Assistant Professor at Yale University.
