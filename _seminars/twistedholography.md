title: "Twisted Holography and Koszul Duality"
excerpt: "Fall 2021"
collection: seminars
---

During Fall 2021, [Dylan Butson](http://www.math.toronto.edu/dbutson/), [Brian Williams](https://sites.google.com/view/brianrwilliams/home?authuser=0), and I are running a learning seminar on the work of Kevin Costello and collaborators on twisted string theory, twisted holography, and relations to koszul duality. The seminar takes place online on **TUESDAYS from 10:00-12:00 EST** unless otherwise stated. Those interested in participating should feel free to contact one of the organizers for a zoom link. I'm keeping some [notes](https://sraghavendran.github.io/files/holography_notes.pdf) which will be updated as the seminar progresses. Any mistakes are mine; let me know if you find any.

    <td><details><summary>From physical holography to Koszul duality</summary><br> 
      	<p> Abstract: I will review how the physics statement of holography can be "twisted" to yield a statement that can be formulated mathematically.  I'll try to start at the beginning, and sketch the idea of twisting supersymmetric theories and supergravity, before moving on to trying to explain what holography looks like once you twist.</p></details></td>

    <td><details><summary>A user's guide to holography</summary><br>
	<p>Abstract: In this talk I want to explain some very basic ideas that appear in twisted holography. In fact, I won’t say anything about supersymmetric twists or AdS/CFT. Rather, I will introduce the basic mathematical ideas involved with framing holographic dualities; the most important of which is the concept of Koszul duality. I’ll work through a simplest example of Koszul duality and will draw parallels with a story in topological field theory.</p></details></td>

    <td><details><summary>Topological strings and Twisted supergravity</summary><br>
	<p>Abstract: To formulate a holographic correspondence at the level of twists, it is useful to have a mathematical way of discussing twists of superstrings. Costello-Li conjecture that certain twists of superstrings are equivalent to topological strings. The goal of this talk will be to  learn to work with the mathematical outputs of this conjecture. I'll introduce topological string analogues of open string field theory and closed string field theory. The former will recover twists of supersymmetric gauge theories, and the latter will contain twists of supergravity. I'll then discuss how to codify some ways in which the open and closed sectors interact.</p></details></td>

    <td><details><summary>Overview of the twisted holography program</summary><br>
	<p>Abstract: I'll outline the general set-up for formulating twisted holography type conjectures following Kevin's program: I'll briefly recall the mathematical avatars of open and closed string field theories discussed in Surya's talk, explain how to use these to (somewhat) systematically extract classical field theory configurations from the string theory input data, and state Kevin's meta-conjecture about the expected holographic principle satisfied by quantizations of these setups, using the perspective on Koszul duality explained in Brian's talk (and his cool new paper with Natalie Paquette! https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10257). In the remaining time, I'll discuss some expectations, methods, and challenges for carefully formulating such conjectures at the quantum level, and briefly survey some of the existing work in the field that we'll be hearing about in later talks.</p></details></td>
