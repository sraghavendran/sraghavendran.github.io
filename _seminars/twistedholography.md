During Fall 2021, [Dylan Butson](), [Brian Williams](), and I are running a learning seminar on the work of Kevin Costello and collaborators on twisted string theory, twisted holography, and relations to koszul duality. The seminar takes place online on **Wednesdays from 10:00-12:00 EST** unless otherwise stated. Those interested in participating should feel free to contact one of the organizers for a zoom link.

      <p> Abstract: I will review how the physics statement of holography can be "twisted" to yield a statement that can be formulated mathematically.  I'll try to start at the beginning, and sketch the idea of twisting supersymmetric theories and supergravity, before moving on to trying to explain what holography looks like once you twist.</p></details></td>
